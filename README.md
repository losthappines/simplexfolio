# simplexfolio
Hi! This is my first repo. I created a simple portfolio page so you do not have to spend a lot of time building from scratch. 

Basically it looks like this:

Also has dark mode/button:

Language button so it supports multiple languages:

You can use it as much as you want, customize it, make some changes to make your own personal site. 
If you do not mind, i'm a beginner, so i used gpt to speed up the process.

P.S. Translations are done by GPT, so if there is anything wrong, do not ask me. 🤷‍♂️

Hope you like it😉
